# Jupyter Notesbooks
Introduction to Visualization Technologies in Common Use. 
This is my fork and I have tried to update the README

## Setup Environment
1. Make sure you have python3 installed. Brew for OSX, you might consider using the WSL on Windows. Linux package managers include `dnf` and `apt` depending on your distribution. 
2. `python3.12 -m venv .venv` : Creates a python virtual environment in the `.venv` subdirectory of wherever you issue this command. (Note: Python 3.13 and above do not yet have all the necessary libraries released for these notebooks.)
3. `source .venv/bin/activate` : Activates that virtual environment 
4. `pip install -r notebooks/requirements.txt` : Installs the libraries necessary to run these notebooks. From the root of this repository it is in the `notebooks/` subdirectory. 
5. `jupyter lab` : Will start your jupyter lab environment and let you see the notebooks.
